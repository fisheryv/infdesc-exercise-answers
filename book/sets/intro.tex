We saw an informal definition of a \textit{set} in \Cref{chGettingStarted}, but so far the only sets that we have seen are the number sets ($\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$ and so on).

In \Cref{secSets}, we will study sets in the abstract---in particular, the sets that we study are arbitrary collections of mathematical objects, not just numbers. This is essential for further study in pure mathematics, since most (if not all) areas of pure mathematics concern certain kinds of sets!

In \Cref{secSetOperations}, we will then define some operations that allow us to form new sets out of old sets, and prove some identities of an algebraic nature that are closely related to the rules governing logical operators and quantifiers that we saw in \Cref{chLogicalStructure}.
