\begin{exercise}
In the following proof that every multiple of four is even, identify all instances where an assumption is stated or cited in order to justify a step in the proof.

\begin{snippet}
Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and suppose that $n$ is divisible by $4$. Then by definition of divisibility we have $n=4k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. But then $n$ is even, since $n = 4k = 2(2k)$ and $2k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{snippet}
