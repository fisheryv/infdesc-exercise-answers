\begin{exercise}
Define a sequence recursively by $a_0 = 4$, $a_1 = 9$ and $a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}$ for all $n \ge 2$. Prove that $a_n = 3 \cdot 2^n + 3^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The \textit{Tribonacci sequence} is the sequence $t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots$ defined by
\[ t_0 = 0, \quad t_1 = 0, \quad t_2 = 1, \quad t_n = t_{n-1} + t_{n-2} + t_{n-3} \text{ for all } n \ge 3 \]
Prove that $t_n \le 2^{n-3}$ for all $n \ge 3$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The \textit{Frobenius coin problem} asks when a given amount of money can be obtained from coins of given denominations. For example, a value of $7$ dubloons cannot be obtained using only $3$ dubloon and $5$ dubloon coins, but for all $n \ge 8$, a value of $n$ dubloons \textit{can} be obtained using only $3$ dubloon and $5$ dubloon coins. Prove this.
\hintlabel{exFrobeniusCoinProblem}{%
Observe that if $n$ dubloons can be obtained using only $3$ and $5$ dubloon coins, then so can $n+3$. See how you might use this fact to exploit strong induction with multiple base cases.

\begin{exercise}
What goes wrong in the proof of \Cref{propSqrt2Irrational} if we try instead to prove that $\sqrt{4}$ is irrational?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
\label{exSquareRootThreeIsIrrational}
Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
\begin{backhint}
\hintref{exSquareRootThreeIsIrrational}
Prove first that if $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $a^2$ is divisible by $3$, then $a$ is divisible by $3$.
\end{backhint}
